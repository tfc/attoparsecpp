# AttoParsec++ Benchmarks

This folder contains some benchmarks for the fundamental parsers
as well as the math expression parser.

## Requirements

You need to have installed:

- `make`
- `wget` for obtaining the `benchmark` library headers
    - You can alternatively just create a `benchpress` folder containing the `benchpress` headers.

## Building and Executing the tests

Just run

``` bash
make
./main
```
