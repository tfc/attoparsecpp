# AttoParsec++ Tests

This folder contains some test cases for the fundamental parsers
as well as the math expression parser.

## Requirements

You need to have installed:

- `make`
- `wget` for obtaining `catch.hpp`
    - if you have a version of `catch.hpp` you can just put it here. `wget` will not be needed, then.

## Building and Executing the tests

Just run

``` bash
make
./main
```
